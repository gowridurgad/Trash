# trfold

## Summary

Perform fold transform on a grammar

## Description

Reads a parse tree from stdin, replaces a sequence of symbols on
the RHS of a rule with the rule LHS symbol, and writes the modified tree
to stdout. The input and output are Parse Tree Data.

## Usage

    trfold <string>

## Example

    trparse A.g4 | trfold "//parserRuleSpec[RULE_REF/text() = 'normalAnnotation']"

## Notes

If you are running MSYS2 on Windows, you may notice that XPaths are not being
processed by this command correctly. To avoid the Bash shell from altering
XPaths, type _export MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL="*"_, then execute your command.
