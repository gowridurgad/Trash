# Trash on the Web

This is a prototype of a website, available [here](http://codinggorilla.com/publish-web-site/wwwroot/),
which I am writing for analyzing, converting,
and modifying parser generator grammars, such as Antlr, Bison, EBNF,
ABNF, etc. The website is a pure Blazor Webassembly implementation.
