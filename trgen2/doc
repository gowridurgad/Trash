 Consider this input, arithmetic with comments.

    1
       // add in factor.
       + 2 * (3-1)

 Output text with modifications for two forms of expression node,
 with the root node still an expression node, but only in name. Intertoken
 spacing remains for tree. All else remains the same.

 '{{' and '}}' denote output text or a replacement tree node.

 Text within '<' ... '>' is an XPath expression. These get placed as new children.

/file_/expression {{<expression[1]><expression[2]><*[2]>}}
(: )//expression[count(atom) = 1] {{<atom><node[0]>}} :)
